Immediately after the Dow crashed more than 2,000 points on March 9, Bound\u00a0lost half a million dollars in active jobs.", "\"It's kind of a slow death. You know, you start laying people off and finishing up the work you have and hoping the phone would ring,\" he said. ", "The Petroleum Equipment & Services Association estimates 103,420 jobs have been lost since the pandemic started, as dozens of producers and service providers have gone out of business. The industry, once booming, wasn't in a good place even before Covid struck. Companies were struggling to stay afloat and looking to merge, burdened by high levels of debt in a global energy market flooded with supply.", "America is now producing 3 million fewer barrels per day than it was in March. That sharp contraction means companies don't need many workers or service providers like Bobby Bounds. \u00a0", "The real tragedy Bounds said isn't his business, but the skilled workers he had to lay off. \u00a0\"They're standing there in front of me and they can't feed their kids. They can't pay their rent,\" said Bounds.", "\u00a0", "The crisis is particularly acute in Midland, the heart of the US shale industry.

Pioneer Natural Resources sits on the region's largest shale assetsas an independent producer. CFO Richard Dealy said the company is aggressively cutting costs and preparing for energy demand to remain stagnant until there is a Covid-19 vaccine.
